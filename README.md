# eTalk: definition and credits

The eTalk, a multimedia editing tool, is the result of collaborative and transdisciplinary work. It is part of a new form of multimodal digital literacy, while respecting the standards of scientific publishing. It is quotable entirely in details through a share button.

The first version of the eTalks code has been developed in 2012-2015 by Frédéric Kaplan and Cyril Bornet (EPFL, CH), in collaboration with Claire Clivaz (Unil, CH), and is available on Github: https://github.com/OZWE/etalk

This new version of the code has been developed by Martial Sankar and Claire Clivaz, SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, 2016-2019, https://github.com/cclivaz/etalk-docker. A course to build your own eTalk is available in the DARIAH platform #dariahTeach (teach.dariah.eu), in the course on Multimodal Literacies: https://teach.dariah.eu/course/view.php?id=24&section=3 

This version of the software has been integrated to SIB GitHub for the SNSF project MARK16: https://mark16.sib.swiss

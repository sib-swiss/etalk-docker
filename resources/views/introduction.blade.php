            <h1>Introduction to MARK16 eTalks</h1>
            <h2>March 2020, DH+ group, SIB, Lausanne</h2>
            <p>This webpage presents eTalks focused on the last chapter of the Gospel according to Mark. The list will be
                regularly completed during the five years of the research project, 2018-2023. They have been produced by the
                SNSF MARK16 project team, or by invited colleagues. A query function allow to look in the metadata and
                content of these eTalks.</p>
            <p>An eTalk is a new multimedia publication tool for research or educational purpose, entirely quotable in
                details (see the <a href="/mode-demploi/">demonstration video</a>). It has been created by an
                interdisciplinary team in 2012-2015 under the lead of Claire Clivaz (UNIL) and Frédéric Kaplan (EPFL), then
                developed in 2016-2019 by Claire Clivaz and Martial Sankar (SIB, DH+ group, Lausanne).</p>
            <p>The code for the eTalk programme is available in open source, along with explanations of how to prepare and
                install eTalks&nbsp;: <a

            <p>We hope that this form of publication will be useful and compelling to a wide academic and public audience.

            <h1>Introduction to MARK16 eTalks</h1>

            <p>This webpage presents eTalks focused on the last chapter of the Gospel according to Mark. Thea are regularly
                completed during the five years of the research project, 2018-2023. They have been produced by the SNSF
                MARK16 project team, or by invited colleagues. A query function allow to look in the metadata of these
                eTalks.</p>
            <p>An eTalk is a new multimedia publication tool for research or educational purpose, entirely quotable in
                details (see the <a href="/mode-demploi/">demonstration video</a>).
                It has been created by an interdisciplinary team in 2012-2015 under the lead of Claire Clivaz (UNIL) and
                Frédéric Kaplan (EPFL). The present version is an updated version of the software produced by Silvano Aldà
                (Core-IT, SIB) and Claire Clivaz (DH+,SIB, Lausanne).</p>
            <p>The code for the eTalk programme is available in open source, along with explanations of how to prepare and
                install eTalks: <a

            <p>We hope that this form of publication will be useful and compelling to a wide academic and public audience.
